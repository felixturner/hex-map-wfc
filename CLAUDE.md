## Critical Rules (ALWAYS follow)

1. NEVER git revert, commit, or push without asking for explicit permission first. No exceptions.
2. NEVER make code changes unless I specifically ask you to. If I ask a question, just answer it.
3. NEVER write to the memories directory. Use `plans/` for TODOs and notes.
4. ALWAYS play audio notification (`afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff`) after completing ANY task or before asking ANY question. Every single response.
5. DON'T run `npm run build` - I'll tell you if the build fails.

## Other Instructions

- Do not present guesses as facts. If you don't know something, say so.
- Don't ask leading questions about next steps
- Console log colors: only use black, green, red, and blue. Never use cyan or other colors.
- Console logs: only log global cell coords, never local cell coords.
